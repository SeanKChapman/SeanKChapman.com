    <div id="description">
        <p>
        I am a college freshman from Palo Alto, CA studying computer science at the
         University of Maryland. Currently, my interests in software development involve
          Android/iOS development in Java and Swift, as well as web programming with HTML, CSS, Javascript,
         and Node.js. I have roughly four years of programming experience in Java and Python.
         Outside of programming, I enjoy fishing, drawing, robotics, and playing video games.

                <u>Maze</u>
            <br>
        Written in Java, this project uses the Recursive
        Depth-first-search algorithm to generate a unique maze. The algorithm works
        by randomly choosing a cell in an arrayList full of cells.
        Then a neighbor to the current cell being observed is randomly chosen, and the
        the wall that separates the two cells is deleted. The neighbor is then
        marked as the current cell. Each cell is marked either visited or unvisited,
        which corresponds to whether or not the cell will be added to the current cell's list
        of neighbors. If the one of the neighbors has already been visited, that cell will not
        be counted as a neighbor.

            <u>Cryptocurrency Information</u>
            <p>
                Uses the coinmarketcap API to fetch cryptocurrency information and
                display it in a table. Uses HTML, CSS, and javascript to make the AJAX request and
                format information in a table.
